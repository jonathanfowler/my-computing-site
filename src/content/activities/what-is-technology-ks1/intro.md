## What is technology?

Technology is something people make to help them do things.

Technology is not just computers or phones.

A pencil is technology. It helps us write.

A chair is technology. It helps us sit comfortably.

A road is technology. It helps people travel.

Some technology is digital, like a smartphone. Some is mechanical, like a washing machine.
