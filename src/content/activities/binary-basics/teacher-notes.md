Learning outcomes

By the end of this activity, pupils should be able to:

- Explain that computers represent numbers using binary (0s and 1s).
- Convert simple binary numbers into denary using place value.
- Describe why binary representation is important in Computing.

Intended year group: KS3 (Year 7–8)

Time required: 10–15 minutes

Prior knowledge: Basic understanding of place value

Common misconceptions: Confusing the direction of place value columns, Treating binary like decimal

Curriculum link: This activity supports understanding of data representation and foundational Computing concepts, aligned with KS3 curriculum expectations and the broader emphasis on digital literacy.

Why this matters: Binary underpins all forms of digital data, including images, sound and text. Secure understanding here supports later work on data representation and compression.
