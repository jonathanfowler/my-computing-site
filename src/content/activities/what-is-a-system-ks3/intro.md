## What is a system?

A system is a group of connected parts that work together to achieve a specific purpose.

Most systems:

- have an input
- carry out some processing
- produce an output

Systems can be non-digital (mechanical or manual), digital (using computers and data), or a combination of both.

### Key takeaway

All digital systems are systems, but not all systems are digital.
