## Digital vs non-digital technology

Technology is anything designed by humans to solve problems or make tasks easier or more efficient. It does not have to be electronic or computer-based.

This lesson focuses on **digital technology** and how it differs from **non-digital technology**.

### Important idea: technology changes over time

Some technologies become digital over time. Older washing machines used mechanical timers; modern ones use microcontrollers and software. The purpose stays the same, but the technology becomes digital.

### Key takeaway

All digital technology is technology, but not all technology is digital.
