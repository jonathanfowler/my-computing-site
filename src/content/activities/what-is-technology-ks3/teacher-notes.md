Learning outcomes

By the end of this activity, pupils should be able to:

- Explain that technology is something designed by humans to solve problems or make tasks easier.
- Identify examples of technology and non-technology from everyday life.
- Match common technologies to the purpose they are used for.
- Describe how a chosen technology helps people complete a task more efficiently.

Intended year group: KS3 (Year 7) 

Time required: 15–20 minutes

Prior knowledge: None required

Common misconceptions: Pupils may think technology only means computers or electronics, Pupils may assume “technology” must use electricity, Pupils may classify natural objects (e.g., trees) as technology, Pupils may struggle to recognise that simple tools (e.g., pencils, scissors) are also technology.

Curriculum link: This activity supports foundational KS3 Computing by developing pupils’ understanding of technology as human-designed tools and systems. It strengthens key vocabulary needed for later learning about digital systems, inputs/processes/outputs, and how computers solve problems.

Why this matters: Many pupils believe Computing is only about programming or devices. This lesson builds a broader and more accurate understanding of technology, helping pupils describe systems clearly and preparing them for later work on digital vs non-digital technology and how digital systems function.

Lesson intro prompt: “Today we’re starting with a big question: what actually counts as technology? A lot of people think technology only means computers or phones, but that isn’t true. Technology includes any tool or system humans design to solve a problem or make life easier. By the end of today’s lesson, you should be able to explain what technology is and give examples of both simple and complex technologies.”
