## Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks which normally require human intelligence, such as recognising images, understanding language, or making decisions based on data.

You will explore what AI is, where it is used in everyday life, and how it differs from traditional computer programs.

## Your task

In this activity, you will:

- Identify examples of Artificial Intelligence used in everyday technologies.
- Distinguish between AI systems and non-AI computer programs.
- Explain, in simple terms, what makes a system an example of AI.
