Learning outcomes

By the end of this activity, pupils should be able to:

- Explain, in simple terms, what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is.
- Identify everyday technologies that use AI.
- Distinguish between AI systems and traditional rule-based computer programs.

Intended year group: KS3 (Year 7–8)

Time required: 15–20 minutes

Prior knowledge: No prior knowledge of Artificial Intelligence required. Pupils should be familiar with everyday digital technologies.

Common misconceptions: Thinking AI is the same as robots or humanoid machines, Assuming all computer programs use AI, Believing AI systems always make correct or unbiased decisions, Overestimating AI’s human-like understanding.

Curriculum link: This activity supports understanding of Artificial Intelligence as part of foundational Computing and digital literacy, aligned with KS3 curriculum expectations and the broader emphasis on emerging technologies and responsible technology use.

Why this matters: AI is increasingly embedded in everyday technologies that pupils use and encounter. Developing a clear understanding of what AI is, and what it is not, helps pupils engage critically with modern digital systems and prepares them for later learning about data, ethics and responsible technology use.
